Number Guessing Game
Description
This project is an interactive game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. With each guess, the player receives a message indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player has 3 lives represented by hearts. Each time the guess is incorrect, the player loses a heart. If all hearts are lost, the player loses the game. If the user guesses correctly, a win message is displayed.
